RESEARCHER
As a climate change researcher, I bring over three years of hands-on experience in hydrological modeling, specifically utilizing
the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, Hydrus-1D, and CropWat model. Proficient in programming languages like Python and R,
as well as GIS software such as ArcMap and QGIS, I excel in data analysis and scientific report writing. Beyond technical skills, I
prioritize collaboration and engagement, working closely with interdisciplinary teams and stakeholders to address climate
change challenges. My ability to communicate findings effectively and foster meaningful partnerships underscores my
commitment to driving impactful change in this field. With a dedication to continuous learning and a passion for
environmental sustainability, I am well-equipped to make valuable contributions as a climate change researcher.
